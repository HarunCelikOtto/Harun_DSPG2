## DSPG Work

### Weekly Mission

This week, I prioritized the following tasks to complete.

-   [x] Test the R package functions being chained together.
-   [x] Work on the R Shiny application template.
-   [x] Automate the Market Size calculations.

### Objectives

Since there are only a couple of weeks remaining to complete the calculations and develop the deliverable application, the goal is to set the base for the application so that I can work on adding features in as they get completed by the students in their sections.

### Additional Work

The following is a screenshot of the R Shiny application and its following is the code used to produce that demo. It's a simple UI for now to just prototype what kind of information we want the final tool to include.

    })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
