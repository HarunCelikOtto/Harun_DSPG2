## DSPG Work

### Weekly Mission

The undergraduate interns finished converting the excel functions as R functions and went through the testing for each of them. This also included exploring what packages and tools existed that could aid the work of some of the functions aimed at automating the workflow. After exploring and testing their functions, the next task delegated to them was to fix the Miro flowchart which documented how their functions connected to each other. The following image shows how the first flowchart was drafted.

Agreeing on the right notation, the students came up with the following version which is much easier to read and was also shared with the client.

The last portion of the flowchart remains to be connected after our meeting with the client since team members just received answers to their questions in a meeting we had with the client. We are also now moving towards phase three of the project which focuses on optimizing the development of the R functions and the development of a tool.

### Objectives

-   [x] Review the function work for any bugs in the [`DSPGGrocery`](https://github.com/DSPG-2023/Grocery) package.
-   [x] Complete Miro diagram of function dependencies.
-   [x] Set up a meeting with client to discuss the function operations material.
-   [x] Investigate software possibilities for the deliverable.
-   [x] Determine a plan to optimize the R functions.

### Additional Work

-   [x] Completed a basic course for C++.
-   [x] Develop a template for an R Shiny app.
-   [x] Look into using `Javascript` with the R Shiny app.
-   [x] Work on developing functions for grabbing location data from the `Google Places API`.

Below is a test data frame which I've made to test the `Google Places API`. I plan to be uploading the functions to display in the following week's blog.

```{r}
# Testing out an example data frame with DT

cities <- c("Ames", "Des Moines", "Waterloo", "Chicago")
lat <- c(42.034534, 41.619549, 42.499504, 41.881832)
lng <- c(-93.620369, -93.598022, -92.358665, -87.623177)

test_cities <- data.frame(cities, lat, lng)
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(test_cities)
```
