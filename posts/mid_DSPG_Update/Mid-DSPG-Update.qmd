## Design Choices

The design choice for using `R` had to do with the software's open source accessibility as well as the possibility of future integration with different software.

::: incremental
-   Automation of data.
-   Interact dynamically with user input.
-   Environmental support for packages.
-   Integration with R Shiny applications.

A look at how the calculations work...
:::

## Loading The Package

<small> One of the first choices we made was to develop the functions in an R Package environment. This means that once the package is complete, it can be compiled and shared with others through online repositories.</small>

Loading the package

``` r
# Import the DSPGGrocery Package
library(DSPGGrocery)
```

Loading the Google API <small> Since the package depends on the Google API, it will also need to be loaded in.</small>

``` r
# Set API Key
googleway::set_key(key = Sys.getenv("PLACES_KEY"))
```

## Estimating Market Size

``` {.r code-line-numbers="|2|9|10-16"}
# Finds distance to points, assigns them to variables
north_dist <- google_distance("42.3053733, -95.0621664","42.373296,-95.1508718")
east_dist <- google_distance("42.3053733, -95.0621664", "42.2669247,-95.0038576")
south_dist <- google_distance("42.3053733, -95.0621664","42.258085,-95.223378")
west_dist <- google_distance("42.3053733, -95.0621664","42.3113755,-95.6832781")

# Makes sample list of cities around Lakeview, calls functions, 
# and assigns them to variables
city_list = list(1117,994, 222, 19, 86, 265)
rural_pop <- Rural_Population(9814, 
                              City_Populations(city_list),
                              Pct_County(north_val,
                                         east_val,
                                         south_val,
                                         west_val, 
                                         1500*.62137119))
town_pop <- City_Populations(city_list)
```

## Estimating Revenue

``` r
# The function takes the values generated from 
# previous calculations and calculates Total Estimated Revenue
Total_Estimate_Revenue(county_pop=9752,
                      towns_pop=City_Populations(city_list),
                      pct_county=Pct_County(north_val,
                                            east_val,
                                            south_val,
                                            west_val, 
                                            1500*.62137119),
                      town_list=list(1117,994,222, 19, 86, 265),
                      metro_list=list(1117),
                      state_index=89.568)
```

## Estimating Expenses

``` {.r code-line-numbers="|3-5|10|12-14|21-23|30|"}
# User Inputs

Monthly_Rent <- 3642
Loan_Amount <- 1500000

Gross_Margin <- Gross_Margin(Total_Estimated_Revenue)
Cost_of_Goods_Sold <- Cost_of_Goods_Sold(Total_Estimated_Revenue)

# Scenario 1 Inputs

Shelving_Check_Out_Counters <- 60000
Computer_Equipment_POS <- 15000
Vehicles <- 12000
Display_Cases <- 15000
Refrigeration <- 20000
Freezers <- 20000
Meat_Cutting_Equipment <- 10000

               Miscellaneous_Assets_1_Use_Life = 10,
               Miscellaneous_Assets_2 = 10000,
               Miscellaneous_Assets_2_Use_Life = 10,
               Miscellaneous_Assets_3 = 10000,
               Miscellaneous_Assets_3_Use_Life = 10)
```

## Estimating Pre-Tax Profit

``` {.r code-line-numbers="|3-9|11-12|14-16|18|"}
# Final Calculations:

Expenses <- Cost_of_Goods_Sold + 
            Employee_Wages + 
            Officer_Compensation + 
            Other_Operating_Expense + 
            Interest_Expense + 
            Annual_Rent + 
            Depreciation_1 

Secondary_Income <- Other_Income + 
                    Interest_Income

Pre_Tax_Profit <- Total_Estimated_Revenue + 
                  Secondary_Income - 
                  Expenses

Pre_Tax_Profit
```
