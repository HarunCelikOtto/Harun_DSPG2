## DSPG Work

### Weekly Mission

This week we had our client meeting arranged towards the end of the week and therefore spent most of our time preparing for that marking our transition to Phase Two of the project. For the meeting the project lead and I agreed that having a preliminary data inventory sketched out and using the CLD3 method to work with our clients in outlining project goals seemed to be the game plan. With that in mind, each student was assigned a portion of the reports and excel workbooks given to us to review, document and explore to share their findings with the client. The meeting turned out to be very fruitful for giving us priorities in our project and supplying us a good sense of direction for the coming weeks. My objectives in this week were to find ways to support the students as they started the data discovery process.

### Objectives

-   [x] Assign interns sections of the Reports to work through.
-   [x] Assign interns sections of the Excel sheet to investigate resources.
-   [x] Create a [data folder](https://github.com/DSPG-2023/Grocery/tree/main/ProjectData) on GitHub to host all public data.
-   [x] Provide students a template for creating a presentation based on the CLD3 method.
-   [x] Create an interactive questionnaire using 'MentiMeter' to work through with the clients.

The following is an example of the kind of data summarizing the students completed for sharing with the client. This one in particular looks at the ACS Data to highlight tables that are relevant for our project.

### Additional Work

While the client meeting preparations took most of my time, I conducted another workshop on introducing to DSPG students `RegEx` in R as well as working with `.Renviron` files using `usethis::edit_r_environ()` to create environmental variables where students could store their API keys. I also took the time to show the teams using python in their projects to utilize the `reticulate` package.

The following images are an example of how we discussed with the client on the data environment and asked them to rank the ideas that they contributed with.

The ranking in 'MentiMeter' for the themes they found the most important were displayed in the following format.
