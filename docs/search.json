The goal of the project is to help users to make better decisions in opening, inheriting, and operating grocery stores in rural environments. The development of the tool relies heavily on the research conducted by domain experts on rural grocery stores and accessibility to verified data on the topic. Our current workflow moving forward is outlined in the following manner.\n\n\n\nWeekly Project Timeline\n\n\nAs we learn more about our data and possibilities for automating processes that our client’s initially calculated manually, we update our vision for what our final deliverable for DSPG could be. A draft of our thoughts are depicted as a tool which takes a certain range of user input and automated data, transforms that data through converted functions, and outputs the results in the most accessible format for the user.\n\n\n\nTool Processes"

We are also now moving towards phase three of the project which focuses on optimizing the development of the R functions and the development of a tool. The project lead and I are working to design how each of the sections will integrate into a single interface.\n\n\n\n\nReview the function work for any bugs in the DSPGGrocery package.\nComplete the Miro diagram of function dependencies.\nSet up a meeting with the client to discuss the function operations material.\nInvestigate software possibilities for the deliverable.\nDetermine a plan to optimize the converted R functions.\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue working through basic courses for C++.\nDevelop a template for an R Shiny app.\nLearn more about Javascript integration with the R Shiny app.\nWork on learning the Google Places API to create functions.\n\nBelow is a test data frame which I’ve made to test the Google Places API. I plan to be uploading the functions for display in the following week’s blog.\n\n# Testing out an example data frame with DT\n\ncities &lt;- c(\"Ames\", \"Des Moines\", \"Waterloo\", \"Chicago\")\nlat &lt;- c(42.034534, 41.619549, 42.499504, 41.881832)\nlng &lt;- c(-93.620369, -93.598022, -92.358665, -87.623177)\n\ntest_cities &lt;- data.frame(cities, lat, lng)\n\n\nknitr::kable(test_cities)\n\n\n\n\ncities\nlat\nlng\n\n\n\n\nAmes\n42.03453\n-93.62037\n\n\nDes Moines\n41.61955\n-93.59802\n\n\nWaterloo\n42.49950\n-92.35867\n\n\nChicago\n41.88183\n-87.62318\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current version of my function that’s being used to pull multiple location data is below.\n\nplaces_multiloc_pull &lt;- function(df, name = NULL, \n                                 search_string = NULL, \n                                 keyword = NULL, \n                                 lat = c(df[,2]),\n                                 lng = df[,3],\n                                 radius = 6500, \n                                 type = NULL, \n                                 api_key = Sys.getenv(\"PLACES_KEY\"), \n                                 place_type = NULL) {\n  \n  result_list &lt;- list()\n  \n  for (i in 1:dim(test_cities)[1]) {\n    \n    start_time &lt;- Sys.time()\n    \n    string &lt;- sprintf(\"df_%f\", i)\n    \n    spring &lt;- noquote(string) \n    \n    spring &lt;- googleway::google_places(search_string = search_string, \n                                   name = name, \n                                   location = c(lat[i], lng[i]), \n                                   radius = radius, \n                                   keyword = keyword, \n                                   key = api_key)\n    \n    \n    Sys.sleep(2)\n    \n    result_list &lt;- append(result_list, list(spring$results))\n    \n    end_time &lt;- Sys.time()\n    total_time &lt;- end_time - start_time\n    print(sprintf(\"Execution time for iteration %d is %.2f\", i, total_time))\n  }\n  \n  return(result_list)\n  \n}"
